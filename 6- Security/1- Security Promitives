# Kubernetes Security Overview

Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for hosting production and grid applications. Security is a primary concern when deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. In this documentation, we provide a high-level overview of the security primitives in Kubernetes before diving deeper into each topic in subsequent sections.

## Securing the Host and Cluster

Before securing Kubernetes itself, it is essential to secure the infrastructure hosting the cluster. The following measures should be implemented:
- Disable root access.
- Disable password-based authentication.
- Enforce SSH key-based authentication.
- Implement additional security measures to protect the underlying physical or virtual infrastructure.

If the host infrastructure is compromised, the entire Kubernetes environment is at risk.

## API Server Security

The Kubernetes API server is at the core of all operations within the cluster. It is accessed via the `kubectl` utility or directly through the API. To ensure security, controlling access to the API server is the first line of defense.

### Authentication
Authentication determines who can access the cluster. Several authentication mechanisms are available, including:
- Static files containing user IDs and passwords
- Token-based authentication
- Certificate-based authentication
- External authentication providers such as LDAP
- Service accounts for machine authentication

These mechanisms ensure that only authorized users and services can interact with the cluster.

### Authorization
Once authenticated, users must be authorized to perform specific actions. Authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes include:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns users to groups with defined permissions.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Grants permissions based on user attributes.
- **Webhook Authorization**: Integrates external authorization systems.

These mechanisms enforce granular access control, preventing unauthorized operations within the cluster.

## Secure Communication

All communication between Kubernetes components is secured using TLS encryption. This includes interactions between:
- The **etcd** cluster
- The **Kube Controller Manager**
- The **Scheduler**
- The **API Server**
- Worker node components such as **Kubelet** and **Kube Proxy**

A dedicated section will cover the implementation of TLS certificates to secure communication between these components.

## Pod and Network Security

By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other. To restrict access between pods, **Network Policies** should be implemented. These policies define rules governing pod-to-pod communication, enhancing security by limiting unauthorized network access.

## Conclusion

This document provided a high-level overview of Kubernetes security. We will explore each security aspect in greater detail in subsequent sections, covering authentication, authorization, TLS encryption, and network policies in practice.
