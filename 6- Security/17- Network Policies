# Network Policies in Kubernetes

## Introduction

Welcome to this lecture on **Network Policies** in Kubernetes. Before diving into the specifics, let's ensure we have a solid understanding of networking and security basics. This foundational knowledge will help us better grasp how network policies function within a Kubernetes environment.

## Traffic Flow Basics

Let’s start with a simple example of traffic flow in a typical web application setup:

1. **Web Server**: Serves the front end to users.
2. **App Server**: Handles back-end APIs.
3. **Database Server**: Stores and retrieves data.

### Traffic Flow Example:
1. A user sends a request to the **web server** on **Port 80**.
2. The web server sends a request to the **app server** on **Port 5000**.
3. The app server fetches data from the **database server** on **Port 3306**.
4. The data is sent back to the user through the app and web servers.

### Types of Traffic:
- **Ingress Traffic**: Incoming traffic to a server (e.g., traffic from users to the web server).
- **Egress Traffic**: Outgoing traffic from a server (e.g., traffic from the web server to the app server).

**Note**: The direction of traffic is determined by where the traffic originates. Responses (denoted by dotted lines in diagrams) are not considered when defining ingress or egress rules.

## Traffic Rules for the Example

To enable the above traffic flow, the following rules are required:
1. **Web Server**:
   - Ingress rule to accept HTTP traffic on **Port 80**.
   - Egress rule to allow traffic to the app server on **Port 5000**.
2. **App Server**:
   - Ingress rule to accept traffic on **Port 5000**.
   - Egress rule to allow traffic to the database server on **Port 3306**.
3. **Database Server**:
   - Ingress rule to accept traffic on **Port 3306**.

## Kubernetes Networking Basics

In a Kubernetes cluster:
- Nodes, pods, and services each have unique IP addresses.
- By default, all pods can communicate with each other without additional configuration (e.g., routes).
- Kubernetes uses a virtual private network (VPN) that spans across all nodes, enabling seamless communication between pods.

### Default Behavior:
- Kubernetes allows all traffic between pods and services within the cluster by default.

## Network Policies in Kubernetes

Network policies are used to control traffic flow between pods. They are particularly useful for enforcing security requirements, such as restricting direct access between certain pods.

### Example Use Case:
Suppose you want to prevent the **front-end web server** from directly communicating with the **database server**. This is a common security requirement to reduce attack surfaces.

### How Network Policies Work:
1. **Network Policy Object**: A Kubernetes object (like pods, replica sets, or services) that defines rules for traffic flow.
2. **Pod Selector**: Network policies are linked to pods using **labels and selectors**.
3. **Rules**: Define which traffic is allowed or blocked.

### Example Policy:
To allow traffic to the database server **only from the app server**:
- Apply a network policy to the database pod.
- Specify an ingress rule that allows traffic from the app server on **Port 3306**.

## Creating a Network Policy

Here’s how to define a network policy in Kubernetes:

### YAML Definition:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: api-server
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306
```

### Key Components:
1. **API Version**: `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
2. **Kind**: `NetworkPolicy`.
3. **Metadata**:
   - `name`: Name of the policy (e.g., `db-policy`).
4. **Spec**:
   - `podSelector`: Selects the pod(s) to which the policy applies (e.g., the database pod).
   - `policyTypes`: Specifies whether the policy applies to ingress, egress, or both.
   - `ingress`: Defines the allowed ingress traffic (e.g., from the app server on Port 3306).

---

## Important Notes

1. **Policy Types**:
   - If `ingress` is specified, only ingress traffic is isolated.
   - If `egress` is specified, only egress traffic is isolated.
   - If neither is specified, no isolation is applied.

2. **Network Solution Compatibility**:
   - Network policies are enforced by the network solution used in the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Not all network solutions support network policies. Examples of supported solutions include:
     - **Calico**
     - **Cilium**
     - **Kube-router**
     - **Romana**
   - **Flannel** does not support network policies as of this recording.

3. **No Error for Unsupported Policies**:
   - If the network solution does not support network policies, the policies will not be enforced, but no error message will be displayed.

---

## Conclusion

Network policies are a powerful tool for securing traffic within a Kubernetes cluster. By defining ingress and egress rules, you can control which pods can communicate with each other, thereby enhancing the security of your applications. Always ensure that your network solution supports network policies before relying on them for production environments.
