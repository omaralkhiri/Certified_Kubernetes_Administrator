# Helm: The Package Manager for Kubernetes

## Introduction to Helm

Kubernetes is a powerful platform that simplifies managing complex infrastructures. However, the complexity of managing applications that run on Kubernetes can become overwhelming. A typical application in Kubernetes is composed of multiple objects that work together. For instance, a relatively simple WordPress site might require the following components:

- A **Deployment** to deploy the pods running the application, such as MySQL database servers or web servers.
- A **Persistent Volume (PV)** to store the database.
- A **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** to request storage from the PV.
- A **Service** to expose the web server running in the pod to the internet.
- **Secrets** to store sensitive data like credentials and passwords.
- Additional components such as periodic backups, jobs, etc.

For each of these components, Kubernetes requires a separate YAML file, and to deploy them, you need to use `kubectl apply` on every YAML file. This process can quickly become tedious and error-prone, especially when you need to make changes to the configuration.

### Managing Complex Applications in Kubernetes

When managing an application in Kubernetes, you may find yourself in situations like:

- **Editing YAML files**: When you download or create YAML files for components like persistent volumes, PVCs, and services, you need to customize them to suit your environment. For example, the default persistent volume might be 20 GB, but you may need more storage. You’ll have to manually edit each relevant YAML file.
  
- **Upgrades**: As time passes, you might need to upgrade some components. This often means editing multiple YAML files to reflect the new configurations.
  
- **Deleting the app**: When you want to delete the application, you need to track down every object that belongs to it and delete them manually.

While you could combine all your YAML files into a single large file, this makes it difficult to troubleshoot and manage. The files would be long and complex, and finding specific components can be cumbersome.

### Enter Helm

Helm simplifies the process by allowing you to manage your Kubernetes applications as **packages**. Kubernetes doesn't inherently recognize an application as a whole. It only knows about individual objects (e.g., deployments, services, and volumes). Helm, on the other hand, treats these objects as parts of a larger whole, a "package."

#### Helm as a Package Manager

Helm functions as a **package manager for Kubernetes**, similar to how a package manager works for software. It allows you to define and manage all the Kubernetes objects related to a single application in one place. Instead of interacting with individual Kubernetes objects, you only interact with the application package as a whole.

- **Installation**: Instead of managing each individual component, you use Helm to install your entire app with a single command. Helm will take care of deploying all the necessary Kubernetes objects for you.
  
- **Customization**: If you need to customize certain values for your app, such as the size of persistent volumes or database credentials, you can specify these values in a `values.yaml` file. This means you don't need to edit each YAML file for individual components.

- **Upgrades**: Helm helps you upgrade your application with a single command. It automatically determines which objects need to be updated to reflect the changes.

- **Rollbacks**: Helm also keeps track of changes and allows you to roll back to a previous version of your app if needed. It manages the versions or "revisions" of your app, making it easy to go back to a stable state.

- **Uninstallation**: When you want to uninstall an app, you no longer need to remember and delete each object one by one. Helm tracks all the objects associated with the app and handles the removal for you.

### Helm: A Command-Line Tool for Kubernetes

At its core, Helm simplifies many aspects of Kubernetes application management. With Helm, you can:

- **Install**: Deploy your entire application with one command.
- **Upgrade**: Update your application with a single command.
- **Rollback**: Revert to a previous version of your application with one command.
- **Uninstall**: Remove all the Kubernetes objects associated with your application using a single command.

This greatly reduces the complexity of managing applications in Kubernetes, enabling you to focus on higher-level concerns rather than micromanaging each individual Kubernetes object.

### A Familiar Analogy

To make this concept easier to understand, think of Helm like a **game installer**. When you download a computer game, it typically consists of thousands of files: executables, audio files, graphics, configuration files, and more. Instead of downloading each file individually, you run an installer that places all these files in their correct locations.

In the same way, Helm automates the installation and management of Kubernetes resources. You don’t have to manually configure every individual object. You just tell Helm what application you want to deploy, and it takes care of the rest.

### Helm in Action

With Helm, you no longer have to micromanage each Kubernetes object. You can treat your Kubernetes apps as packages, letting Helm handle the installation, customization, upgrades, rollbacks, and uninstallation. Helm reduces the burden of working with complex applications, allowing you to focus on the overall configuration and functionality.
