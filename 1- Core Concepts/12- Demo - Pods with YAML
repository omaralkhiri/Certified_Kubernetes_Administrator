### Creating a Pod Using a YAML Definition File

In this section, we will learn how to create a **Kubernetes pod** using a **YAML definition file** instead of using the `kubectl run` command. The goal here is to define the pod specifications in a YAML file, which allows for more control and flexibility over the configuration.

### Tools for Creating YAML Files

You can create a YAML file using any text editor, such as:

- **Windows**: You could use **Notepad** or better alternatives like **Notepad++** for syntax highlighting.
- **Linux**: Use native editors such as **Vim** or **nano**. It is advisable to use an editor with syntax support for YAML to ensure that the formatting is correct.

For this demonstration, we will use the **Vim** text-based editor on a Linux system. If you're using a different environment, you can choose any text editor that suits your needs.

### Steps to Create the YAML Definition File

1. **Open the editor**: On the Linux terminal, type the following command to create a file called `pod.yaml` using the Vim editor:

    ```bash
    vim pod.yaml
    ```

2. **Start with Root-Level Properties**: The Kubernetes pod definition YAML file must contain four root-level properties: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec`. These properties are required for every Kubernetes object.

   - **apiVersion**: This specifies the version of the Kubernetes API being used for the pod. For a pod, use `v1`.
   - **kind**: This defines the type of Kubernetes object being created. In this case, we use `Pod` (case-sensitive).
   - **metadata**: This section includes identifying data about the pod, such as its name and labels.
   - **spec**: This section defines the specification of the pod, such as the containers that it will run.

3. **Define Metadata**: Under the `metadata` section, define:
   - **name**: The name of the pod. In this case, the name will be `nginx`.
   - **labels**: Labels are key-value pairs that help categorize and organize objects. For example, you can define a label `app: nginx` to specify that this pod is related to the Nginx application. You can also add additional labels, such as `tier: frontend`, to provide further categorization.

4. **Define the Spec Section**: The `spec` section defines the container specifications:
   - **containers**: This is a list of container objects. For each container:
     - **name**: The name of the container inside the pod, which in this case is `nginx`.
     - **image**: The Docker image for the container. In this case, we will use the official `nginx` image from Docker Hub.

   Note: You can define multiple containers within a pod. Each container would be defined as an item in the list. For this demo, we will use only one container (nginx).

### YAML Definition Example

The following is an example of the YAML file that defines a pod running the Nginx container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
```

### Saving the File

Once the file is created in the editor:
1. Save the file and exit the editor by typing the following in Vim:

    ```bash
    :wq
    ```

2. You can verify the file's content using the `cat` command:

    ```bash
    cat pod.yaml
    ```

   This will display the YAML content, ensuring it follows the correct structure and indentation.

### Creating the Pod Using the YAML File

To create the pod from the YAML file, you can use the `kubectl create` or `kubectl apply` command. Both commands can be used to create new objects, but `kubectl apply` is preferred for maintaining and updating objects.

To create the pod using the `kubectl create` command, run the following:

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```

This will create the pod in your Kubernetes cluster based on the specifications in the `pod.yaml` file.

### Verifying the Pod Creation

1. **Check the Pod Status**: You can check the status of the pod using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Initially, the pod might be in the **ContainerCreating** state. After a short time, it should transition to the **Running** state.

2. **Get Detailed Information**: To see more detailed information about the pod, use the `kubectl describe` command:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod nginx
    ```

    This will show information about the pod, such as when it was created, the assigned labels, the Docker container(s) inside it, and any events associated with the pod.

### Conclusion

In this section, we learned how to create a **Kubernetes pod** using a **YAML definition file**. To summarize:

- The YAML file for Kubernetes objects includes four top-level properties: **apiVersion**, **kind**, **metadata**, and **spec**.
- **metadata** contains identifying data such as the **name** and **labels** of the pod.
- **spec** defines the containers in the pod, including their names and Docker image names.
- We used the `kubectl create -f` command to create the pod from the YAML file.
